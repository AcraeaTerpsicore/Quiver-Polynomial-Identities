| `"/mnt/d/Software/Wolfram Research/Mathematica/14.0/wolframscript.exe" -file tests/run_tests.wl` | Runs seven VerificationTests that recreate Examples 1–3 from the paper: incidence masks for $A_2$ and the three-vertex quiver, $\varphi_Q$ evaluations, bounded path enumeration, and Monte Carlo checks that $[x_1,x_2]x_3$ (Example 1) and $[x_1,x_2][x_3,x_4]$ (Examples 2–3) vanish on the corresponding incidence algebras. | Pass (all tests succeeded) |

All tests were executed from `/mnt/d/ExplorerDownload/arXiv-2511.03536v1` inside WSL (Arch) using Mathematica 14's `wolframscript`.
